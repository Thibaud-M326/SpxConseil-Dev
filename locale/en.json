        "text": "Mission at the heart of our priorities: the professionalization of students. Serving as a bridge between the associative world and the employment sector, the action of SPX-Conseil, and more broadly, the movement as a whole, focuses daily on the deployment and implementation of theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired within our school in the professional sector. An undeniable enhancement of our teachings for an enriched professional experience for students â€“ that is the objective of SPX-Conseil, which, every year, can rely on my support. I am proud to have in our ranks a student association that successfully combines entrepreneurial spirit and community service."
